# Soil-Based Crop Prediction Model

## Project Description

This machine learning project aims to assist farmers in selecting the optimal crop for their fields based on essential soil metrics. Using a dataset of soil measurements, we've developed a multi-class classification model to predict the most suitable crop for given soil conditions.

## Data

The dataset `soil_measures.csv` contains the following features:

- "N": Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
- "P": Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
- "K": Potassium content ratio in the soil
- "pH": pH value of the soil
- "crop": Target variable (categorical) representing various crops

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Selection
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation

## Results

Our best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% in predicting the optimal crop based on soil measurements. The single most important feature for predictive performance was found to be [Feature Name].

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional soil and environmental factors
- Develop a user-friendly interface for farmers
- Explore transfer learning for different geographical regions
